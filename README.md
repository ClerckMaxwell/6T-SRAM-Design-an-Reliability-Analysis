# 6T-SRAM-Design-an-Reliability-Analysis
This project explores the design, characterization, and reliability of a 6-transistor (6T) SRAM cell implemented in 100 nm CMOS technology. The analysis focuses on the trade-off between static stability (Noise Margins) and power dissipation, identifying the operational limits through Data Retention Voltage (DRV) estimation.
